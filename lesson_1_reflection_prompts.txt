How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed only those portion of code that were different, so I have not to
	look at entire code. It is very easy to find error in 2 lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can compare all the versions at the same time. Also I can experiment on my 
	code as previous version is saved as backup.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manual saving gives you more flexibility. but it also depends on users
	memory. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git way is better. Since in most projects all files are interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first use git log to find the ids of various versions and then use 
	git diff id1 id2 to find the difference between two ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
